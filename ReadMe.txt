Please use the format of "cat input.txt | swift main.swift HH:mm"

If values want to be changed in the input file, the file must be called input.txt

If you do not include the HH:mm i have just grabbed the time now as an easy validation work around.

I did run out of time to create unitTests but If i had more time I would add them to test expected behaviours aswell as supporting more potential unexpected inputs in the code.

Such as 6:10 would change to 06:10 which wouldnt be difficult to do with more time aswell as rounding with X's. 

Also I would have liked to sort out force casting as I mainly envisioned it for testing but ran out of time to guard
