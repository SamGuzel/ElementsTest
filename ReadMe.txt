Please use the format of "cat input.txt | swift main.swift HH:mm"

If values want to be changed in the input file, the file must be called input.txt

If you do not include the HH:mm i have just grabbed the time now as an easy validation work around.

I've used two more input files in UnitTests to allow me to fake inputs without breaking the main's input.txt file.


If I had more time:

Some Unit tests created and ran to try catch anything major missed, with more time I'd have vastly increased them

Added some extra validation such as H:mm -> 0H:mm and more, with more time I'd have gone over more cases.


INSTRUCTIONS:

open terminal in file location
input in the format of: cat input.txt | swift main.swift HH:mm
